# README

Hi! I'm Jaroslav and this is README manual for my personal traits.

I also keep here track of random things I don't want to forget.

If not in person, you can find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jaroslavkubicek), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KubajzHK), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26373323-jaroslav-kub-ek)

## About me

According to Myers-Briggs personality types, I'm an **[INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality)**.

This poses the following personality traits:

- I'm an introvert so I recharge when doing individual activities at home or outside alone - reading, running, biking, trekking
- I usually work on many things at once and I genuinely dive into more when I discover something new which makes great sense - even when I'm already way too busy
- Any administration, rudimental work (especially in paper form!) is unnecessary in my eyes and more challenging to finish than releasing change over 20 different microservices into production -> you might have a difficult time getting documents from my business trip just for the sake of obedience to law
- I like to keep things in order, in small iterations, in both life & development - multiple small improvements > one big cleanup after a long time of having things in disarray
- I don't like bro culture and people who excessively drink, smoke or do other *uncultured* things and place this attitude in front of others as something to be proud of.
- I deeply enjoy working with people who are great at my weaknesses (to help me overcome them), honest, direct and self-driven
- I started this README & Trello board as my way of learning how to finish things.

## Values

- Passivity kills creativity & creates technical debt
- Any technology or programming language is tool you can change, not golden calf.
- If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him.

## TODOs

I started tracking my development TODOs (out of my daily tasks) in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/TlUj6zcw/todos)

## Lifetime goals

These are some long-term, life goals I would like to accomplish so I can tell myself I went through life to its fullest potential and feel ultimately happy. Some items might change, disappear or to be added.

- Do marathon under 3:30 h
- Do the whole Route 40 in Argentina + Carretera Austral in Chile
- Get pilot licence to fly with Cessna
- Learn to sail
- Climb mountain with attitude 6000 m above sea level
