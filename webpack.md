# Webpack 

## Migration from v4 to v5

- polyfills are NOT automatically added when native node.js module is imported
    - it's better to use package variants from npm only
- `webpackChunkName` comments no longer needed
    - chunk name can be autogenerated by `optimization: { chunkIds: 'named' }`
